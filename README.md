# sc_transcriptome_ana
Problem setting: 

single cell spatial transcriptomic data, each spot usually covers >1 cells, to infer potential cellular interactions, we need to infer the cell components at the spots as well as the gene sets which indicate functional modules describing cellular states. 

Data preparation: 

Simulation: with scRNAseq of known celltypes
Visium: Brain, Breast cancer, 
DBiT-seq: Yale, Siyu lab

Models:

Autoencoder
Variational autoencoder 
infinite mixture of VAEs
semi-supervised learning
image super-resolution
